# hv-query - Collective Knowledge Search

## Purpose
Search the hAIveMind collective memory and query specialized agents for comprehensive answers combining stored knowledge with real-time expertise.

## When to Use
- **Troubleshooting Issues**: Find solutions to problems encountered before
- **Best Practices**: Learn how other agents handle similar situations

- **Incident Research**: Find related incidents and their resolutions
- **Technical Questions**: Tap into specialized agent knowledge
- **Historical Context**: Understand past decisions and their outcomes

## Syntax
```
hv-query "question or topic" [category] [options]
```

## Parameters
- **question** (required): Clear, specific question or topic to search
- **category** (optional): Narrow search to specific memory types
  - `infrastructure`: Server configs, network topology, hardware

  - `deployments`: Release procedures, rollbacks, configurations
  - `security`: Vulnerabilities, patches, compliance, audits
  - `monitoring`: Alerts, metrics, dashboards, thresholds
  - `runbooks`: Procedures, scripts, operational guides
- **options** (optional):
  - `--agent=name`: Query specific agent directly (e.g., --agent=elastic1-specialist)
  - `--recent=hours`: Limit to memories from last N hours (e.g., --recent=24)
  - `--semantic`: Use semantic search only (default: hybrid)
  - `--exact`: Use exact text matching only

```
üîç hAIveMind Collective Query: "elasticsearch high CPU usage solutions"

üìä Search Results Summary:
‚úì 12 memories found across 3 categories
‚úì 4 specialized agents consulted
‚úì 3 exact matches, 9 semantic matches
‚úì Confidence: High (87%)

üß† Agent Expertise (elastic1-specialist):
"High CPU in elasticsearch typically stems from:
1. Inefficient queries with wildcards or regex
2. Large aggregations without proper field data cache
3. Concurrent indexing during peak query times
4. JVM heap pressure causing excessive GC

Immediate actions:
- Check slow query log: GET /_nodes/hot_threads
- Review field data circuit breaker: GET /_cluster/settings
- Implement index throttling during peak hours"

üìö Collective Memory Matches:

üî¥ [INCIDENT-2025-01-20] elasticsearch CPU spike to 95% on elastic1
   Resolution: Implemented query timeout of 30s, optimized wildcard queries

- "elasticsearch monitoring best practices" (15 memories)
```

### Agent-Specific Query Response  
```
üéØ Direct Agent Query: security-analyst

Question: "JWT token expiration best practices"

üîí Security Analysis:
"Current industry standards for JWT expiration:

Access Tokens: 15-30 minutes maximum
- Short lifespan limits exposure if compromised
- Forces regular rotation through refresh cycle
- Balances security with user experience

Refresh Tokens: 1-7 days depending on sensitivity
- Longer lifespan for seamless user experience  
- Should be rotated on each use (sliding window)
- Store securely, revoke immediately on suspicious activity

Implementation recommendations:
1. Use 'exp' claim for automatic expiration
2. Implement token blacklisting for immediate revocation
3. Set 'nbf' (not before) for delayed activation
4. Monitor for unusual token usage patterns"

üìã Related Security Memories:
- JWT security audit findings (2025-01-22)
- OAuth2 token management guidelines (2025-01-20)  
- Session management security review (2025-01-19)

‚ö†Ô∏è  Security Alerts:
- No active JWT-related security incidents
- Last security review: 2025-01-20 (passed)
```

```

### Comparative Queries
```
hv-query "mysql vs postgresql for high-write workloads"
hv-query "docker vs kubernetes for microservice deployment"
hv-query "nginx vs apache performance comparison"
```

## Error Scenarios and Solutions

### No Results Found
```
‚ùå No memories found for: "rare-technical-term"
üí° Suggestions:
- Try broader search terms: "database" instead of "postgresql-13.2"
- Search different categories: try "infrastructure" if "incidents" returns nothing
- Ask specific agents: --agent=database-specialist
- Check spelling and try synonyms
```

### Agent Unavailable
```
‚ùå Agent 'elasticsearch-expert' not responding
‚úì Falling back to collective memory search
‚úì Found 8 related memories from other sources
üí° Try again later or query similar agent: elastic1-specialist
```

### Ambiguous Query
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Query too broad: "server issues" 
üìä Found 247 potentially relevant memories
üí° Suggestions to narrow down:
- Add category: "server issues" infrastructure
- Be more specific: "server high CPU usage"
- Add time constraint: --recent=24
```

## Best Practices
- **Be Specific**: Include system names, error codes, context
- **Use Categories**: Narrow searches for faster, more relevant results
- **Query Experts**: Use --agent= for specialized technical questions
- **Follow Suggestions**: Use "Related Queries" to discover more information
- **Check Recency**: Use --recent= for time-sensitive issues
- **Combine Results**: Use both memory search and agent expertise
- **Learn from History**: Query past similar situations before asking agents

## Related Commands
- **Before querying**: Use `hv-status` to see available agents
- **After finding info**: Use `remember` to store your own learnings
- **For urgent issues**: Use `hv-delegate` to assign resolution tasks
- **To share findings**: Use `hv-broadcast` to inform collective

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Query Performance
1. Use more specific search terms to reduce result set
2. Add category filters to limit search scope  
3. Check network connectivity to agents: `hv-status`
4. Clear query cache if results seem stale

### Irrelevant Results
1. Use exact phrase matching with quotes: "exact error message"
2. Add negative terms: elasticsearch NOT jenkins  
3. Specify category to filter out unrelated memories
4. Query specific agents instead of general search

### Missing Expected Information
1. Information might be stored in different category
2. Try different search terms or synonyms
3. Query specific agents who might have undocumented knowledge
4. Check if information was recently added with --recent
