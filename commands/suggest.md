💡 Reasoning Behind Top Suggestions:

🎯 Incident Response Priority:
   Your system shows an active database incident, so suggestions prioritize immediate response:
   1. Assess scope (hv-status)
   2. Engage specialists (hv-delegate)
   3. Coordinate team (hv-broadcast)
   4. Research solutions (hv-query)

🔍 Context Factors Considered:
   ✓ Active incident detected → Emergency response commands prioritized
   ✓ Database specialists available → Delegation commands highly recommended
   ✓ Recent database work → Database-focused suggestions emphasized
   ✓ Python project context → Development-aware recommendations
   ✓ Business hours → Team coordination commands prioritized

🚀 Optimization Insights:
   ↳ Your recent pattern shows good research habits - continue with hv-query
   ↳ Database specialists are online - leverage their expertise with hv-delegate
   ↳ Incident response workflow detected - follow systematic approach
   ↳ Documentation habits are good - maintain with remember commands

🎯 Success Probability Analysis:
   ↳ Suggested sequence has 94% success rate based on similar situations
   ↳ Database specialist availability increases delegation success to 96%
   ↳ Current system state optimal for suggested diagnostic commands
   ↳ Team coordination commands highly effective during business hours

📊 Alternative Approaches:
   If immediate incident response isn't needed:
   • Focus on proactive monitoring: hv-status → remember → hv-delegate monitoring
   • Emphasize documentation: recall → remember → hv-broadcast
   • Optimize workflows: workflows → examples → help
