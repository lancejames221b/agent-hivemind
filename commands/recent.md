   4. Use commands to build history for analysis
```

### Inaccurate Success Rates
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Success rates don't match actual experience
üí° Troubleshooting:
   1. Success tracking depends on command completion detection
   2. Network timeouts may be misclassified
   3. Manual verification of recent command outcomes
   4. Report discrepancies for system improvement
```

### Performance Analysis Issues
```
üêå Pattern analysis taking too long or failing
üí° Resolution Steps:
   1. Reduce history limit for faster analysis
   2. Check system resources during analysis
   3. Clear analysis cache if available
   4. Report performance issues for optimization
```

## Best Practices for Command History Analysis
- **Regular Review**: Check recent commands daily to identify patterns and issues
- **Learn from Failures**: Analyze failed commands to prevent future issues
- **Optimize Patterns**: Use successful patterns as templates for future work
- **Share Insights**: Document and share successful patterns with team
- **Track Improvements**: Monitor how changes affect success rates and efficiency
- **Use for Planning**: Let recent patterns inform future workflow planning
