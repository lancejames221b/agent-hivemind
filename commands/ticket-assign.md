# ticket-assign - Intelligent Ticket Assignment

## Purpose
Assign tickets to hAIveMind agents with automatic capability matching, workload balancing, and agent coordination through the collective intelligence network.

## When to Use
- **Task Delegation**: Assign specific tickets to appropriate agents
- **Workload Balancing**: Distribute work across available agents
- **Capability Matching**: Find agents with required skills for tickets
- **Agent Coordination**: Enable cross-agent collaboration on complex work
- **Auto-Assignment**: Let hAIveMind choose the best agent automatically

## Syntax
```
ticket-assign <ticket_id> [agent_id] [options]
```

## Assignment Methods

### Specific Agent Assignment
```
ticket-assign WEBTESTS-1 frontend-specialist
ticket-assign API-DEV-5 backend-agent --priority high
```

### Auto-Assignment by Capabilities
```
ticket-assign WEBTESTS-1 --auto --skills "frontend,ui,testing"
ticket-assign INFRA-3 --auto --capabilities "infrastructure,docker,monitoring"
```

### Best Available Agent
```
ticket-assign API-DEV-5 --best-available
ticket-assign WEBTESTS-2 --best-available --exclude overloaded-agents
```

### Team Assignment
```
ticket-assign COMPLEX-1 --team "frontend-agent,backend-agent" --collaboration
```

## Agent Discovery Features

### Capability Matching
The system automatically:
- Analyzes ticket requirements and complexity
- Matches required skills to agent capabilities  
- Considers agent specializations and experience
- Reviews agent performance on similar tickets

### Workload Balancing  
- Checks current agent workload and capacity
- Considers ticket priorities and deadlines
- Balances work distribution across agents
- Avoids overloading high-performing agents

### Agent Coordination
- Links related tickets for collaboration
- Sets up cross-agent dependencies
- Enables knowledge sharing between agents
- Coordinates handoffs and reviews

## Real-World Examples

### Frontend Work Assignment
```
ticket-assign WEBTESTS-1 --auto --skills "react,css,testing" --description "Login form needs responsive design and validation"
```
**Automatic Matching:**
- Finds agents with React and CSS expertise
- Prioritizes agents with testing experience
- Considers UI/UX specialization
- Balances current frontend workload

### Infrastructure Task Delegation
```
ticket-assign INFRA-3 --delegate --requirements "docker,kubernetes,monitoring" --priority critical
```
**hAIveMind Delegation:**
- Searches collective for infrastructure specialists
- Finds agents with Docker/K8s experience
- Considers monitoring setup expertise
- Prioritizes based on critical urgency

### Complex Multi-Agent Work
```
ticket-assign COMPLEX-1 --team "data-engineer,ml-specialist,frontend-agent" --coordination "sequential" --handoff-protocol
```
**Team Coordination:**
- Assigns to multiple specialized agents
- Sets up sequential workflow coordination
- Establishes handoff protocols
- Links agents for knowledge sharing

## Assignment Options
- **--auto**: Automatic agent selection based on capabilities
- **--best-available**: Choose best available agent right now
- **--skills "list"**: Required skills for the work
- **--capabilities "list"**: Required agent capabilities
- **--exclude "agents"**: Exclude specific agents from selection
- **--priority**: Assignment priority (affects agent selection)
- **--deadline**: Work deadline (influences agent availability)
- **--team "list"**: Multi-agent team assignment
- **--collaboration**: Enable cross-agent collaboration features
- **--delegate**: Use hAIveMind task delegation system
