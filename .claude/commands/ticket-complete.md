# ticket-complete - Finish Ticket Work with Hooks

## Purpose
Complete ticket work with automatic post-work synchronization hooks that store results, document lessons learned, and share discoveries with the hAIveMind collective.

## When to Use
- **Finish Ticket Work**: Mark ticket as completed
- **Knowledge Capture**: Store comprehensive results and lessons
- **Discovery Sharing**: Broadcast important findings to other agents
- **Project Coordination**: Update dependent work and relationships

## Syntax
```
ticket-complete <ticket_id> [options] --summary "Work completed summary"
```

## Features

### Automatic Post-Work Hooks
When you complete a ticket, the system automatically:
1. **Updates ticket status with detailed completion notes**
2. **Stores comprehensive results in hAIveMind memory**  
3. **Documents lessons learned and troubleshooting solutions**
4. **Shares important discoveries with other agents**
5. **Coordinates with dependent tickets and agents**

### Knowledge Preservation
- Captures detailed work results and outcomes
- Documents troubleshooting steps and solutions
- Records lessons learned for future work
- Links completion to related memories and tickets

### Network Coordination
- Broadcasts discoveries to hAIveMind collective
- Updates dependent work and blocking relationships
- Triggers sync with network-wide knowledge distribution
- Notifies coordinating agents of completion

## Real-World Examples

### Complete Web Testing Ticket
```
ticket-complete WEBTESTS-1 --summary "Login form validation implemented" --lessons "Email regex validation tricky - use /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/" --discovery "Found Chrome autofill conflicts with validation"
```
**Automatic Actions:**
- Updates WEBTESTS-1 status to done
- Stores validation implementation details
- Documents regex solution for future use
