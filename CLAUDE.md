# CLAUDE.md - ClaudeOps hAIveMind DevOps Memory System

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ClaudeOps hAIveMind Overview

**ClaudeOps** is a **hAIveMind** - a centralized multi-agent DevOps memory MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables multiple Claude agents to collaborate on DevOps tasks across your entire infrastructure. The system provides persistent memory storage, real-time synchronization, agent coordination, and infrastructure management capabilities.

### hAIveMind Features:
- **Collective Intelligence**: Claude agents share knowledge, delegate tasks, and coordinate responses across infrastructure
- **Infrastructure Configuration Sync**: SSH configs, service configs, and other critical DevOps assets synchronized across the network
- **DevOps Memory Categories**: Specialized storage for infrastructure, incidents, deployments, monitoring, runbooks, and security
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Agents broadcast discoveries, query each other's knowledge, and coordinate autonomous responses
- **Distributed Storage**: ChromaDB for vector storage, Redis for caching, with conflict resolution via vector clocks

## Architecture

- **memory_server.py**: Main MCP server that interfaces with Claude Code via stdio protocol
- **remote_mcp_server.py**: FastMCP-based remote server for HTTP/SSE access via Tailscale network
- **sync_service.py**: FastAPI REST service for machine-to-machine synchronization via Tailscale network
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for semantic search and embeddings storage at `/data/chroma/`
- **Redis**: Caching layer for fast memory access and real-time sync capabilities
- **Tailscale Integration**: Secure network communication between machines (lance-dev, ljs-macbook-pro, m2, max)

## Development Commands

## Troubleshooting

- MCP integration requires `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` in Claude Code settings
- Redis connection issues: Check Redis service and config.json settings
- Machine discovery requires Tailscale running and correct hostnames in config
- Sync failures often relate to API token configuration or port 8899 accessibility
- hAIveMind agent registration requires Redis for coordination features to work
- ClaudeOps hAIveMind features require the updated config.json with claudeops section
- if you get an mcp failure for haivemind, we need to stop and fix it.
- also for each ticket can you add haivemind awareness so it can learn across the system when necessary fro this project:
- then also put these in sequence with storyname -> ticket, and maybe order they should be done in. if they can be done in parallel add 1a, 1b to them or some kind of lettering .
