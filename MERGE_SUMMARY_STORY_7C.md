**Original Implementation**: `743434e`  
**Date**: 2025-01-24

## ðŸ”§ Merge Resolution Details

### Conflicts Resolved
**File**: `src/memory_server.py`  
**Issue**: Both Story 7c (Interactive Help System) and Advanced Rules System were added in the same location

**Resolution**: Integrated both systems to coexist:
```python
# Import Interactive Help System
try:
    from interactive_help_mcp_tools import register_interactive_help_tools
    INTERACTIVE_HELP_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    INTERACTIVE_HELP_AVAILABLE = False
    logger.warning("Interactive help system not available - missing dependencies")

# Import Advanced Rules System  
try:
    from advanced_rules_mcp_tools import AdvancedRulesMCPTools
    ADVANCED_RULES_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    ADVANCED_RULES_AVAILABLE = False
    logger.warning("Advanced rules system not available - missing dependencies")
```

### Integration Points
1. **Import Section**: Both systems imported with proper error handling
2. **Initialization Section**: Both systems initialize independently
